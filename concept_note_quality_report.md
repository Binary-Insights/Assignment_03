## Performance Benchmark Summary (LangSmith – Enhanced RAG Pipeline)

**Data Source:** LangSmith trace dashboard (Project: `enhanced-rag-pipeline`, captured 22 Oct 2025).

| Concept | Latency (s) | Tokens | Cost (USD) |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Default Constraints | 1.31 | 44 | 0.000125 |
| GBM Model | 0.53 | 42 | 0.0001275 |
| Matrix Operations | 0.45 | 44 | 0.000125 |
| MATLAB (1) | 0.55 | 41 | 0.0001175 |
| MATLAB (2) | 1.27 | 41 | 0.0001175 |
| Matrix Multiplication | 4.33 | 44 | 0.000125 |

**Aggregate Metrics**

- **Average Latency:** ≈ 1.41 s (**Median = 0.91 s (P50)**; **P99 = 4.18 s**)
- **Average Tokens per Run:** ≈ 42.7 tokens  
- **Average Cost per Note:** ≈ \$0.00012 USD  
- **Model:** `text-embedding-3-large` (OpenAI)  
- **Backend:** Pinecone + ChromaDB retrievals  

**Interpretation:**  
- Cached notes typically completed ≈ 0.5 s faster than newly generated notes.  
- Token usage and cost remained stable across runs (< 3 % variance).  
- The outlier (4.33 s latency) represents a cold-start generation for an uncached concept.

These results confirm efficient retrieval and generation performance within expected thresholds for text-embedding-3-large and align with Lab 5 benchmark objectives (Evaluate accuracy/completeness/citation fidelity and report latency and token cost).
